    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      This website is created by <a href="https://aaronsaray.com">Aaron Saray</a> and sponsored by
      <a href="https://morebetterfaster.io">More Better Faster</a>, Aaron's company. Primarily it is
      used as an experimental ground for trying out new technologies. But, instead of creating
      numerous useless test websites and "todo" apps, Aaron decided to make a simple game instead.
      This way he can experiment with new technology while letting random visitors have a little
      fun.
